## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [ ] Basic text input interface

## Implementation Recommendation

**Start with Option A (Telegram Bot)** because:
- Faster to implement and test
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to scale later
- Less authentication complexity

**Migration path**: Can later add Option B for personal use while keeping bot for public use.

## Security & Privacy Considerations
- Secure storage of Telegram credentials
- Rate limiting for TTS requests
- Message content privacy
- Proper error handling for failed deliveries

## Estimated Development Time
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days

**Total**: ~1-2 weeks for a complete solution

## Questions for Further Consideration
1. Should this be a personal tool or public service?
2. Do you prefer web interface or command-line interface?
3. What's your budget preference for TTS services?
4. Any specific languages you want to prioritize?
5. Should it support multiple recipients per message?
